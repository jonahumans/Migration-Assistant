This classic design will keep you cool and dry as you slam your way into the local record books. Our art is permanently imprinted into the performance fibers keeping them vibrant and colorful throughout the life of the shirt. It will never crack, fade or peel. The UPF 50+ Sun Protection Performance Long Sleeve shirt offers superior sun protection and performance qualities. Featuring UPF 50+, The UPF 50+ UV (Sun) Protection Performance shirt is both breathable, lightweight, comfortable, and sure to keep the sun's rays from penetrating through to your skin. The 4.1-ounce, 100% Microfiber Polyester fabric is powered by our PURE-tech moisture-wicking technology which is permanently infused in the fibers of the fabric. PURE-tech's intelligent design is shown to improve the body's core performance as it moves perspiration away from the body, pushing it outside the shirt. Because of this technology, our UPF 50+ UV (Sun) Performance Shirts dry far faster than standard cotton garments. Our UPF shirts also include M-Shield which keeps our fabrics fresh, attractive and ready for more. The Zinc based, acquios technology enhances durability without impacting thermomigration. M-Shield technology is Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified and BlueSign System approved for sustainability.
